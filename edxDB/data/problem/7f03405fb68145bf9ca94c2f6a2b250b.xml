      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>
A mouse click event involves two actions, pressing the mouse button and releasing it. Therefore, when we click on the source object, the <b>mousePressed()</b> method is invoked first, followed by the <b>mouseReleased()</b> method. Finally, the <b>mouseClicked()</b> method is invoked.
