    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Both <b>int</b> and <b>float</b> are 32-bit types. All the 32 bits of <b>int</b> are used for representing the integral part of a numerical value. However, for <b>float</b>, some bits are used for representing the integral part and some for the decimal part. When assigning a large integral value to a <b>float</b> variable, the reduced number of bits for its integral part may not be able to precisely represent the large value. Therefore, calculating the difference between <b>int</b> and <b>float</b> variables of the same large numerical value, may not always give a result of 0. You may want to test the code indicated above in a Java program.</p>
