      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>
After executing the first two lines of the code segment, <b>i</b> will have a value of 10 and <b>j</b> a value of 25.
</p>
      <p>
When executing the third line of the code segment, <b>i</b>'s value is increased by 5 and the result is assigned back to <b>i</b>. Thus <b>i</b> becomes 15.
</p>
      <p>  
When executing the fourth line of the code segment, <b>j</b>’s value is divided by <b>i</b>’s value and the result is assigned back to <b>j</b>. That is, <b>j = 25 / 15</b>. Since it is an integer division, <b>j</b> becomes 1.
</p>
      <p>
In the last line, the variable result is assigned the value of <b>i</b> + <b>j</b>, which is equal to 15 + 1 = 16.
