      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>When we have multiple constructors, Java will try to decide which constructor to invoke by inspecting the parameter list of the constructor invoking statement. </p>
      <p>The statement <b>Week3Quiz q1 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10);</b> is used to construct <b>q1</b>. The first parameter is of type <b>double</b>, and the second parameter is of type <b>int</b>. Therefore, the constructor below is invoked and x is initialized to i - d which is equivalent to 0.0.</p>
      <pre>
public Week3Quiz(double d, int i) {
   x = i - d;
}
</pre>
      <p>The statement <b>Week3Quiz q2 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10.0);</b> is used to construct <b>q2</b>. The first parameter is of type <b>int</b>, and the second parameter is of type <b>double</b>. Therefore, the constructor below is invoked and x is initialized to i + d which is equivalent to 20.0.</p>
      <pre>
public Week3Quiz(int i, double d) {
   x = i + d;
}
