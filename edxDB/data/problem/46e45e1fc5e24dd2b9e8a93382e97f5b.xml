        <p>Explanation: </p>
        <p>
From the 2D square apple problem, we can observe that the worm would be able to eat through all the apples if it starts from a location with a red apple. By applying the same rule in the 3D square apple problem, we can quickly tell that the worm cannot eat through all the apples if it starts from the center of the cube, which contains a green apple. Similarly, you can quickly tell that the worm can eat through all the apples if it starts from a corner of the cube, which contains a red apple.
