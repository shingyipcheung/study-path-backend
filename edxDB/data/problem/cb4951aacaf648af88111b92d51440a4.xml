      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Floating point numbers are not represented precisely in a computer. Therefore, the result "0.01" obtained from multiplying 0.1 to 0.1 is different from the "0.01" represented by 0.01 directly.</p>
      <p>If we wish to test for equality between two floating point numbers, we may find the absolute difference between the two numbers and check to see if this difference is smaller than a threshold, e.g. 0.0001.</p>
      <p>
As an example, if we really wish to check 0.1 * 0.1 == 0.01, we may write the Boolean expression below and check to see if the result is true or false.
</p>
      <pre>
Math.abs(0.1 * 0.1 - 0.01) &lt; 0.0001;
</pre>
