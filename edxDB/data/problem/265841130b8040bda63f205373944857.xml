      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>
  The <b>compareTo()</b> instance method of the String class compares lexicographically the character sequence represented by the current String to the character sequence represented by the other String object.
</p>
      <p>  
A negative integer is returned when the current String is lexicographically less than the other String. A positive integer is returned when the current String is lexicographically greater than the other String. 0 is returned if the two Strings are equal.
</p>
      <p>
In the first comparison, the character 'z' is lexicographically greater than the character 'A'. Thus a positive value is assigned to the variable <b>v1</b>. In the second comparison, the character 'Z' is lexicographically less than the character 'a. Thus, a negative value is assigned to the variable <b>v2</b>.
