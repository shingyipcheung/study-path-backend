Introduce a topological ordering option in the score table. 2. If I am taking this course, it would be difficult for me to tell the difference between the pathways and choose one to follow. Would it be possible to provide some descriptions (e.g., most efficient, most comfortable) in each pathway (instead of just naming pathway 1, pathway 2)."

When mouse pointer is hovered over a node, some dependency links are highlighted, maybe it is better to also highlight the corresponding numbers indicating strength.
2. I am not sure whether showing the average scores is helpful for students to learn. Maybe students just focus on getting a high score instead of mastering the knowledge. But if you do want to show scores, it may be better to show SD too."

I think it could be even better if students could have more interactions on the website. For example, if the student still donâ€™t understand the question after the explanation. There could be an outlink of sending email to the instructor or students who have answered this question. This could stimulate group study environment in my opinion."
